NextJS **framework for ReactJS**

wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework


well ... first of all React is a "Library" for Javascript. that seems to be important for some people.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (thoug it does way more tan just).

feature of NextJS:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimizatio
- Much More
